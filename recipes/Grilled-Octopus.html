    <h2> What is Grilled Octopus ?</h2>
    <p> It is pretty self explanatory. It is finished with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, salt, and a sprinkling of parsley. Simple, yet deliciously satisfying!</p>
    <h2> Recipe Overview</h2>
    <p><strong> Step 0: Cooking the Octopus</strong><br>
        Boil it first, then let it cool down to room temperature and quickly grill it, so it gets a nice char.<br>
        <br>
        <strong> Step 1: Seasoning The Octopus</strong><br>
        Season it with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, dried oregano, fresh parsley and garlic (optional).<br>
        <br>
        <strong> Step 2: Add Some Creativity</strong><br>
        After grilling you can use a mix of your favorite spices, if the ones I’m suggesting don’t sound good to you.<br>
